I have given a task to make project of medical analysis whether the person s suffering from tuberculosis or not
There are two  target values :  GeneXpert Test [], Chest X-ray Results,
We use Function model API not sequential model
M1 use GeneXpert Test as target value
M2 use Chest X-ray Results as target value
We need to use feature engineering to filter out irrelevant features like city etc 
then use the remaining features to predict the output

i need to make a function model using TensorFlow which predicts a person is suffering from TB( tuberculosis) if both models M1 and M2 predicts he is having TB  

data has following features
